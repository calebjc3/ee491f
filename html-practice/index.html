  <h2>A Bit of Random Information About Lions</h2>
  <p class="important">Lions are interesting and very cool animals. They sleep a lot, eat meat, and the dude lions have
    epic hair. Lions are found in Africa, where they chill on the savannah and look epic. See image below for epicness
    of male lion. The Latin name for the lion species is Panthera Leo. Lions are muscular cats with short round heads
    and round ears. Their necks are pretty short but that's probably just becuase they don't wanna look like those
    giraffes (weirdos). Lions have fur that ranges in color from silvery gray to yellowish red. Baby lions are actually
    spotted but the spots fade as the lion grows up. The lion is rivaled only by the tiger in terms of length, weight
    and height.</p>
